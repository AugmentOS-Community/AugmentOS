## Developer Guide | How to build your own AugmentOS app

For developers,

AugmentOS is the best way to write a smart glasses app because it enables:

1. Your single app runs on any pair of smart glasses.
2. Access to smart glasses I/O continously
3. Running multiple apps running at the same time

AugmentOS is a fully open source OS for wearables. The AugmentOS SDK is a lightweight wrapper (Python, C++, Javascript, more) that allows any existing app to run as an AugmentOS app, in the cloud or on the edge. 

To get started, check out our [Example App](https://github.com/TeamOpenSmartGlasses/AugmentOS-Example-App).
