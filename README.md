# Convoscope - Smart Glasses Super App

#### A suite of smart glasses and web tools to augment conversations.

Convoscope provides a suite of tools for smart glasses, with a focus on augmenting conversations with live proactive agents.

Convoscope answers your questions before you even ask. It does so by listening to your conversations and proactively providing useful definitions and insights to help you understand what is said, have better ideas, and more effectively solve problems. It runs on smart glasses for IRL conversations or on a laptop for meeting rooms and video calls.

## Features / Tools

#### "Mira" AI Assistant

Say "hey Mira" and then ask a question. Mira is a AI agent with internet access waiting to answer your questions.

- "hey Mira, how long is a direct flight from Toronto to Hong Kong?"
- "hey Mira, what's the weather like this weekend in Cambridge?"
- "hey Mira, how much does YC invest in each company and what do they take?"
- "hey Mira, who won the World Cup last again?"

##### What Does It Do?

- Someone mention a company you've never heard of? The Definer AI agent instantly shows you a definition of that company.
- Your friend asked what the weather's supposed to be like this weekend, and no one knows? Before you've even thought to pull out your phone, the QuestionAnswerer AI agent has searched the web and overlaid the forecast on your vision.
- Everyone in the meeting is saying the same thing?  The Devil's Advocate AI agent presents an alternative viewpiont to stimulate thought.
- Someone makes a claim you're not sure of? The Fact Checker AI agent checks the fact and provides a source to back it up or show that it's false.
- Can't remember what your colleague said they are using for cloud services? The system searches your past conversations and pulls up the answer as soon as you realize you need it.

#### Language Learning
An app to learn a new language 10x faster with smart glasses. Translation, AI foreign language conversations, word/phrase suggestions, immersive AR language annotations, etc. Original smart glasses language learning video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFBEG1s27uU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFBEG1s27uU)

#### Screen Mirror

Mirror anything on your screen to your smart glasses. We use a lightweight, novel approach, which makes it very fast and makes text easy to read. Some examples of what you can do with it:

- Listen to podcasts and stream the video text and captions to your glasses from YouTube.
- Stream your phone camera viewfinder to your glasses to get the perfect pose while taking a group shot.
- Watch your Uber arrival status while waiting with your friends.
- Be the ultimate karaoke master, streaming lyrics to your glasses from Spotify.
- Stream Strava/fitness data to your glasses while exercising.
- Watch tutorials/lessons with your phone in your pocket - when you're walking, working out, running, etc.
- Pull up recipes on your phone and read them on your glasses.
- Stream your grocery list while at the store instead of pulling out your phone every 3 minutes.
