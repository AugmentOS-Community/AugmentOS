AugmentOS is the *the* way to build apps for smart glasses. For developers, it's a no-brainer, because AugmentOS-SDK enables:
- Your app to immediately runs on any pair of smart glasses.
- Simple + fast dev - focus on building a great experience.
- Continuously access smart glasses I/O.
- Run always - run your app for days straight, guaranteed.
- Get seen - get your app in front of everyone using smart glasses.

AugmentOS enables you to run multiple apps *at the same time* so you can truly take advantage of AI-first wearables apps. Apps that run proactively based on context. That's the power of a smart glasses operating system.

## Apps

Some of the apps running on AugmentOS...

#### "Mira" AI Assistant

Smart and fast AI assistant with access to Google search. Say "Hey Mira" and then ask a question/say a command. 

- "hey Mira, how long is a direct flight from Toronto to Hong Kong?"
- "hey Mira, what's the weather like this weekend in Cambridge?"
- "hey Mira, how much does YC invest in each company and what do they take?"
 
#### Screen Mirror

Mirror anything on your screen to your smart glasses. We use a lightweight, novel approach, which makes it very fast and makes text easy to read.

#### Mentra Merge: Proactive AI Agents

Convoscope is a suite of proactive AI agents to augment conversations. Imagine a council of superintelligent assistants listening in to your conversation and helping you solve problems, have new ideas, and better connect with those you're speaking with

## Developer Guide | How to build your own AugmentOS app

Documentation: [docs.AugmentOS.org](https://docs.AugmentOS.org).

For developers,

AugmentOS is the best way to write a smart glasses app because it enables:

1. Your single app runs on any pair of smart glasses.
2. Access to smart glasses I/O continously
3. Running multiple apps running at the same time

AugmentOS is a fully open source OS for wearables. The AugmentOS SDK is a lightweight wrapper (Python, C++, Javascript, more) that allows any existing app to run as an AugmentOS app, in the cloud or on the edge.
