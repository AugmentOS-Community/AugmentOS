## AugmentOS SDK

For developers,

AugmentOS SDK is the best way to write a smart glasses app because it enables:

1. Your single app runs on any pair of smart glasses.
2. Access to smart glasses I/O continously - **alongside other apps running at the same time**

AugmentOS is a fully open source OS for wearables. The AugmentOS SDK is a lightweight wrapper (Python, C++, Javascript, more) that allows any existing app to run as an AugmentOS app, in the cloud or on the edge. 

## Apps

#### Screen Mirror

Mirror anything on your screen to your smart glasses. We use a lightweight, novel approach, which makes it very fast and makes text easy to read. Some examples of what you can do with it:

- Listen to podcasts and stream the video captions to your glasses from YouTube
- Watch your Uber arrival status while waiting with your friends.
- Be the ultimate karaoke master, streaming lyrics to your glasses from Spotify
- Stream Strava/fitness data to your glasses while exercising
- Pull up recipes on your phone and read them on your glasses.
- Stream your grocery list while at the store instead of pulling out your phone every 3 minutes.
- Stream your phone camera viewfinder to your glasses to get the perfect pose while taking a group shot
- Watch tutorials/lessons with your phone in your pocket - when you're walking, working out, running, etc.


#### Live Captions

#### ADHD Glasses

A 10 minute short term memory buffer to help get back on track during conversations after a zone-out.
