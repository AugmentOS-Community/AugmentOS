# Boot Receiver Implementation Summary

## Implementation Details

The boot receiver functionality has been successfully implemented according to the BOOT_RECEIVER_PLAN.md. This implementation allows the AsgClientService to start automatically when the device boots up, while respecting Android's restrictions on starting foreground services directly from broadcast receivers.

### Components Implemented

1. **AsgClientBootReceiver**
   - A broadcast receiver that listens for BOOT_COMPLETED and QUICKBOOT_POWERON actions
   - Launches the BootstrapActivity instead of starting the service directly

2. **BootstrapActivity**
   - A transparent, no-UI activity that acts as a bridge between the boot receiver and the service
   - Starts AsgClientService as a foreground service
   - Self-terminates after ensuring the service has started

3. **AndroidManifest.xml Changes**
   - Added registration for AsgClientBootReceiver
   - Added declaration for BootstrapActivity with appropriate theme and flags
   - Removed old BootReceiver registration

4. **Changes in augmentos_core**
   - Renamed the existing BootReceiver.java to BootReceiver.java.bak
   - Created a marker file BootReceiver.java.deprecated
   - Updated AndroidManifest.xml to remove the boot receiver registration

### Removed Components

1. **Old BootReceiver.java**
   - Replaced with AsgClientBootReceiver which follows the bootstrap activity pattern

2. **BootService.java**
   - No longer needed since BootstrapActivity now handles the service startup

## Testing Instructions

To test this implementation:

1. Install the app on a device
2. Reboot the device
3. Verify that AsgClientService starts automatically after boot
4. Check the logs for messages from AsgClientBootReceiver and BootstrapActivity
5. Confirm that the service remains running after the activity has terminated

## Additional Notes

- This implementation follows Android best practices for starting foreground services after boot
- The transparent activity approach eliminates UI flicker during the boot process
- This design is compatible with all Android versions that support foreground services
