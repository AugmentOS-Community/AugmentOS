  - Share with Testers Dialog (embedded in TPAList)
  - Delete Confirmation Dialog (embedded in TPAList)

### 4.3 Data Models

#### TPA Model

```typescript
interface TPA {
  packageName: string;     // Unique identifier (lowercase, numbers, dots, hyphens)
  displayName: string;     // User-friendly name
  description: string;     // Description of the TPA
  webhookURL: string;      // Endpoint for events
  logoURL: string;         // URL to TPA icon
  webviewURL?: string;     // Optional URL for mobile interface
  tpaType: 'standard' | 'background';  // Type of TPA
  status: 'active' | 'inactive';       // Current status
  createdAt: string;       // Creation date
}
```

### 4.4 Form Validation

The Create/Edit TPA form includes validation for:

- Package name: Must match the pattern `^[a-z0-9.-]+$`
- Display name: Required field
- Description: Required field
- Webhook URL: Must be a valid URL
- Logo URL: Must be a valid URL

### 4.5 Mock Data Approach

For the MVP, the application uses mock data structures to simulate API calls:

- Mock TPA data for listing and details
- Simulated API key management
- Mocked form submissions

## 5. User Flows

### 5.1 TPA Creation Flow

1. User navigates to Dashboard or TPA List
2. User clicks "Create TPA" button
3. User fills out the TPA creation form
4. User submits the form
5. User receives confirmation and API key
6. User is redirected to TPA List

### 5.2 TPA Management Flow

1. User navigates to TPA List
2. User can:
   - View all their TPAs
   - Search/filter TPAs
   - Click on actions (edit, API key, share, delete)
3. Edit: Navigate to Edit TPA form
4. API Key: View/regenerate API key in modal
5. Share: Add tester emails in modal
6. Delete: Confirm deletion in modal

### 5.3 API Key Management Flow

1. From TPA List, user clicks "Manage API Key" action
2. Modal displays current API key (masked)
3. User can copy the key to clipboard
4. User can regenerate the key (with warning)
5. On regeneration, new key is displayed

## 6. Implementation Plan

### 6.1 Phase 1: Core Structure

1. Set up React project with TypeScript, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui
2. Implement routing with React Router
3. Create DashboardLayout component
4. Implement basic page components

### 6.2 Phase 2: TPA Management

1. Implement TPA List page with mock data
