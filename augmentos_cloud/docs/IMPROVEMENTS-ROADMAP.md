# AugmentOS Improvements Roadmap

This document outlines the improvements that have been implemented and those that are planned for the AugmentOS Cloud system.

## Completed Improvements

### 1. TPA Server Registration System

The TPA Server Registration System allows Third-Party Applications (TPAs) to register their servers with AugmentOS Cloud. This solves the critical issue of maintaining TPA connections when TPA servers restart.

**Key Features:**
- Server registration with webhook URLs
- Session tracking to associate servers with user sessions
- Server heartbeats to monitor TPA server health
- Automatic recovery when TPA servers restart

**Files:**
- `/packages/cloud/src/models/tpa-server.model.ts`
- `/packages/cloud/src/services/core/tpa-registration.service.ts`
- `/packages/cloud/src/routes/tpa-server.routes.ts`
- `/packages/sdk/src/types/webhooks.ts` (updated with new types)

**Documentation:**
- `/docs/TPA-SERVER-REGISTRATION.md`

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling in SDK

Improved error handling in the SDK to prevent TPAs from crashing when receiving invalid data.

**Key Features:**
- Comprehensive message validation
- Error isolation to prevent cascading failures
- Data sanitization for each message type
- Better binary data handling
- Improved WebSocket connection management

**Files:**
- `/packages/sdk/src/tpa/session/index.ts`
- `/packages/sdk/src/tpa/session/events.ts`
- `/packages/sdk/src/tpa/session/layouts.ts`

**Documentation:**
- `/docs/sdk/ERROR-HANDLING-ENHANCEMENTS.md`

### 3. Automatic Resource Management

A system for automatically tracking and cleaning up resources in the SDK to prevent memory leaks and resource exhaustion.

**Key Features:**
- Automatic tracking of timers, event handlers, and other resources
- Centralized cleanup with dispose() method
- Integrated with TpaSession for WebSocket cleanup

**Files:**
- `/packages/sdk/src/utils/resource-tracker.ts`
- `/packages/sdk/src/tpa/session/index.ts` (integration)

**Documentation:**
- `/docs/sdk/RESOURCE-TRACKER.md`

### 4. Connection Health Monitoring

A robust system for monitoring WebSocket connection health and detecting stale connections.

**Key Features:**
- WebSocket ping/pong heartbeat mechanism
- Connection activity tracking
- Automatic detection and closure of stale connections
- System health statistics logging
- Improved connection reliability

**Files:**
- `/packages/cloud/src/services/core/health-monitor.service.ts`
- `/packages/cloud/src/services/core/websocket.service.ts` (integration)

**Documentation:**
- `/docs/CONNECTION-HEALTH-MONITORING.md`

## Planned Improvements

### 1. Display System Enhancements (In Progress)

Improve the DisplayManager to provide more reliable displays on smart glasses within hardware constraints.

**Features Implemented:**
- Configuration system to replace hardcoded values ✅
- Enhanced logging and metrics collection ✅
- Improved request validation and error handling ✅
- Robust throttling with proper queue management ✅
- Better background lock management ✅
- State verification and recovery mechanisms ✅

**Remaining Work:**
- Thorough testing with various TPAs
- Integration with existing services
- Performance tuning and optimization
- Documentation updates

**Documentation:**
- `/docs/DISPLAY-MANAGER-IMPROVEMENTS.md`

### 2. Enhanced SDK Developer Experience

Make the SDK more intuitive and developer-friendly.

**Features to Implement:**
- More declarative API
- Better TypeScript typing
- Improved documentation and examples
- Developer utilities for testing and debugging
- Enhanced error messages

### 4. Multi-Environment Support

Better support for TPAs to connect to different environments (development, staging, production).

**Features to Implement:**
- Dynamic environment configuration
- Environment-aware webhooks
- Testing tools for multi-environment setup
- Improved TPA server registration for environment management

### 5. Security Enhancements

Strengthen the security of the platform.

**Features to Implement:**
- More robust API key validation
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Better authentication flows
- Enhanced encryption for sensitive data
- Improved permission model

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Q2 2023**: TPA Server Registration System, Enhanced Error Handling, Automatic Resource Management
2. **Q3 2023**: Connection Health Monitoring, Display System Enhancements
3. **Q4 2023**: Enhanced SDK Developer Experience, Multi-Environment Support
4. **Q1 2024**: Security Enhancements, Performance Optimization

## Next Steps

The most immediate next steps are:

1. **Testing TPA Server Registration**: Test the TPA registration system with real TPAs
2. **Implementing Connection Health**: Add heartbeat mechanism for WebSocket connections
3. **Enhancing Documentation**: Create more detailed documentation for developers
4. **Developing Sample TPAs**: Create sample TPAs that showcase the new features
