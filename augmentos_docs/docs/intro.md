# Welcome to AugmentOS SDK

*Last updated: March 31, 2025*

## What is AugmentOS?

AugmentOS is a cloud operating system for smart glasses that handles the hard parts: connections, Bluetooth, streaming, and more. This lets you focus on creating great smart glasses apps.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center', margin: '20px 0'}}>
  <AugmentOSArchImage width={500} />
</div>

As a Cloud OS, you can write apps in JavaScript/TypeScript (with Python coming soon) and use our SDK to build for smart glasses. Our SDK enables you to access smart glasses I/O with low latency from a cloud application.

## Compatible Hardware
