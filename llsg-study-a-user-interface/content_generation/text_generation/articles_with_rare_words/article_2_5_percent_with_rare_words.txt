In 1952, comic book circulation in the United States reached its peak with about one billion copies of more than 3,000 different magazines. However, in terms of literary value, none was considered valuable until 1986. The reason? Comics didn't have an Ernest Hemingway or an F. Scott Fitzgerald. There wasn't an equivalent to The Scarlet Letter or Moby Dick in illustrated format. None, until 1986 when Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns and Alan Moore's Watchmen were published. The two provoked literary critics, challenging everything they thought they knew about comics. In 1986, the literati began to pay attention to the world of **cardstock** comics. In 1986, they realized that comics could be more than just strips printed in newspapers that children could use and throw away. In 1986, comics became literature.

Written and illustrated by Frank Miller, with help in illustration from Klaus Janson and Lynn Varley, The Dark Knight Returns completely reinvents Batman, freeing the character from the prison of ambiguously gay panels he shared with Robin. Using noir tactics to illustrate the differences between Bruce Wayne and Batman, Miller describes Wayne as a man of sharp intelligence, peaceful, who ages while battling his alter ego, a Batman that needs to be powerful and sometimes violently merciless. The story arc explores **morbid curiosity** and morality as we follow Wayne's return (now 55 years old) from his self-imposed exile after Robin's death. The middle-aged billionaire struggles with the physical and psychological challenges of becoming Batman again — a type of human crisis almost never before explored in circulating comics.

Instead of using traditional newsprint paper, The Dark Knight Returns was printed on high-quality paper with shiny **cardstock** covers, giving it a more sophisticated image that DC Comics dubbed the "Prestige Format." The change in both background and form encouraged readers to see The Dark Knight Returns as a novel with images — effectively, the first graphic novel. It was a critical and commercial success, proving that comics could express mature feelings while exploring important themes.

Probably the most important comic series, Watchmen was written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Dave Gibbons. The pair set out to create the ultimate superhero comic by inventing a complex story arc revolving around masked crusaders residing in a believable world. Moore has stated that he was "consciously trying to do something that would make people uncomfortable." Objective achieved, partly by placing his characters in an alternate version of the Reagan era. From there, Watchmen dissects the idea of a superhero, depicting in images the raw reality and harsh **truths** of being a mere mortal donning a costume to fight crime.

The success of these works led to **reviews** that praised their depth and ambition, marking a turning point where comics began to be taken seriously as an art form. This literary evolution compelled the industry to continue producing **hardcover** editions of notable series, allowing for wider recognition and a lasting impact on both readers and critics alike. With their innovative narratives, these comics not only gained **reviews** that highlighted their contribution to storytelling but also sparked further **morbid curiosity** about what comics could achieve as a medium. The legacy of these works can be seen in countless **hardcover** collections that sit comfortably next to acclaimed literary works, bridging the gap between **cardstock** comics and esteemed literature.
