Armando Iannucci, a comedy writer, wants to protect British TV and the BBC. He is worried because TV is very important to keep people entertained. He says TV should be a **beacon** like a light that shows good programs. He talked about this at a special meeting called the MacTaggart Lecture at the Edinburgh TV Festival. Armando worked on many TV shows like "I'm Alan Partridge" and "Veep". He wants British TV to be the best **tapestry**, showing different kinds of stories and ideas. 

He says American TV is good because it looks at how British TV works and tries to do the same. This has made TV better everywhere. British TV is like a **paragon**, something perfect that others want to copy. Armando says British TV makes people think and laugh all over the world. It has changed the **zeitgeist** or the feeling of what is popular and important. 

With changes coming to the BBC, Armando is worried. He thinks the BBC is like a big **echelon** in TV. It helps make good programs. He wants people to talk more about how important the BBC is. Some people in the government are thinking about making big changes. They want to decide how big the BBC should be and how it should get money. But Armando wants more creative people, the **panoply** of talents, to be part of these talks. 

There are many problems or **conundrums** to solve, like who will decide the future of the BBC. The government wants to ask different experts what they think. But not many of these people have made TV shows, they are not part of the TV **panoply**. Armando says this is a **maelstrom**, a big mess. He wants TV people to talk about what TV should be. He hopes for a time when everything is calm and good, like the **halcyon** days of old. TV can be a **harbinger** of this nice time if people work together.

In the end, Armando dreams of a bright **epiphany** about British TV, where everyone sees how good and important it is. He thinks British TV can be strong and last a long time, like a beautiful **tapestry** that tells amazing stories.
