Before O1

Roberto Chicas doesn’t use Uber anymore. In fact, he can't do much since he met Patrick Karajah. It was a night in late September when Chicas, a **waiter** from San Francisco, did what many San Francisco residents do: he used Uber to get home. Karajah, the **driver** on **demand** who responded to his **request**, picked up Chicas and his two friends. During the trip, his friends say, everyone had opinions on which way to go. Finally, near the I-280, in a small **plot** of **land** with **weeds** between a **complex** of housing and the **highway**, Karajah pulled everyone out of the car, took out a **hammer**, and allegedly hit Chicas in the face with it just once. Then, Karajah got back into his car and left, leaving Chicas semi-conscious on the **sidewalk** with multiple **fractures** of his **skull**. Roberto Chicas has very good reasons to hate Uber.

The first time I used Uber, nothing like what happened to Chicas happened to me. It was probably something like what happened to you. We were at a friend’s **birthday** party, and after some **songs**, some questionable dancing, and even more questionable drinks, my wife and I ended up on the street and in the rain. **Taxis** are a precious find in most of San Francisco, even more so on nights of **niebla** and **humidity**. We were stranded and needed to get home to relieve the **babysitter**, so I took out my phone, downloaded the Uber **application**, added my credit card details, and ordered a car. It arrived within just a few minutes, and I can say now it was a **relief**. I had waited longer for a **sandwich**.

This is why Uber is great: supreme, ridiculous, an almost ostentatious convenience. It's a company built to cater directly to what seems to be the guiding principle of 21st-century urban life. There are many trying to take a slice of this **market** "on **demand**" (**services** of **waiter** on **demand**, dry cleaning on **demand**, haircuts on **demand**, ice cream on **demand**, marijuana on **demand**), but let's be honest, anyone who knows anything knows this: Uber is the best. It is more powerful, more convenient, and more available than any other service in the **market**.

Uber makes everything very easy, even hating it. Not as much as Roberto Chicas, but something more uncertain, more flexible, and harder to pin down.

The company, valued at 18 billion dollars and increasing, holds a strange position in the tech industry. Among a **complex** of highly **detested** companies in a highly **detested** business, it is the one people hate the most. And the reactions against it are strong, instinctive, and often hard to express.


After O1

Roberto Chicas doesn’t use Uber anymore. In fact, he can't do much since he met Patrick Karajah. It was a night in late September when Chicas, a waiter from San Francisco, did what many San Francisco residents do: he used Uber to get home. As a waiter, Chicas was familiar with the city's demand for services. Karajah, the driver on demand who responded to his request, picked up Chicas and his two friends. He made a request for a safe and quick trip home. During the trip, his friends say, everyone had opinions on which way to go. Finally, near the I-280, in a small plot of land with weeds between a complex of housing and the highway, Karajah pulled everyone out of the car, took out a hammer, and allegedly hit Chicas in the face with it just once. He wielded the hammer with surprising strength. Then, Karajah got back into his car and left, leaving Chicas semi-conscious on the sidewalk with multiple fractures of his skull. The sidewalk disturbance drew attention. Passersby noticed the sidewalk disturbance. The fractures indicated a severe impact. The skull showed visible signs of trauma. Roberto Chicas has very good reasons to hate Uber.

The first time I used Uber, nothing like what happened to Chicas happened to me. It was probably something like what happened to you. We were at a friend’s birthday party, and after some songs, some questionable dancing, and even more questionable drinks, my wife and I ended up on the street and in the rain. The birthday celebrations were lively. After some songs, they played popular songs throughout the evening. Taxis are a precious find in most of San Francisco, even more so on nights of niebla and humidity. The niebla reduced visibility on the streets. The humidity made the weather uncomfortable. On busy nights, taxis are scarce. We were stranded and needed to get home to relieve the babysitter, so I took out my phone, downloaded the Uber application, added my credit card details, and ordered a car. The application was user-friendly. It arrived within just a few minutes, and I can say now it was a relief. The relief was palpable. I had waited longer for a sandwich. I decided to grab a sandwich before leaving.

This is why Uber is great: supreme, ridiculous, an almost ostentatious convenience. It's a company built to cater directly to what seems to be the guiding principle of 21st-century urban life. There are many trying to take a slice of this market "on demand" (services of waiter on demand, dry cleaning on demand, haircuts on demand, ice cream on demand, marijuana on demand), but let's be honest, anyone who knows anything knows this: Uber is the best. It is more powerful, more convenient, and more available than any other service in the market. The market continues to grow rapidly. Consumers expect services to be available on demand. Additional services have been introduced to meet customer needs.

Uber makes everything very easy, even hating it. Not as much as Roberto Chicas, but something more uncertain, more flexible, and harder to pin down.

The company, valued at 18 billion dollars and increasing, holds a strange position in the tech industry. Among a complex of highly detested companies in a highly detested business, it is the one people hate the most. The complex dynamics of the industry contribute to its challenges. The company's detested reputation was hard to overcome. And the reactions against it are strong, instinctive, and often hard to express.
