Before O1:

The reason? Comics did not have an Ernest Hemingway or an F. Scott Fitzgerald. There was no equivalent to The Scarlet Letter or Moby Dick in illustrated format. None, until 1986 when Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns and Alan Moore's Watchmen were published. The two works provoked literary **critics**, challenging everything they knew about comics. In 1986, literary people began to pay attention to the world of comics. In 1986, they realized **comics** could be more than just strips printed in newspapers that children would use and then throw away. In 1986, comics became literature.

Written and illustrated by Frank Miller, with help on illustration from Klaus Janson and Lynn Varley, The Dark Knight Returns completely reinvents Batman, freeing the character from the **prison** of ambiguously gay **frames** he shared with Robin. Using noir tactics to illustrate the differences between Bruce Wayne and Batman, Miller describes Wayne as a man of sharp **intelligence**, peaceful while aging as he battles with his alter ego, a Batman who needs to be powerful and, at times, violently merciless. The storyline explores **mortality** and morality as we follow Wayne’s return from his self-imposed **exile** after Robin’s death. The middle-aged **billionaire** struggles with the physical and psychological **challenges** of becoming Batman again - a kind of human **crisis** almost never explored before in comics in **circulation**.

Instead of using traditional newspaper **cardboard**, the four-issue series of The Dark Knight Returns was printed on high-quality paper with glossy **cardboard** covers, giving it a more sophisticated image dubbed “Prestige Format” by DC Comics. This change in **frames** and form **encouraged** The Dark Knight Returns to be read as a novel with images — effectively, the first graphic novel. It was a great **success** both commercially and critically, proving comics could express mature **feelings**, while exploring important themes.

Probably the most important series in comics, Watchmen was written by Alan Moore and illustrated by Dave Gibbons. The pair set out to create the ultimate superhero **comic** by inventing a complex story arc centered around masked **costume** crusaders residing in a believable world. Moore has stated he was “consciously trying to do something that would make people uncomfortable.” Goal achieved, partly by placing his characters in an alternate version of the Reagan era. From there, Watchmen dismantles the **notion** of a superhero, describing the raw **reality** and harsh **truths** of being an ordinary mortal who dons a **costume** to fight crime.

With the **critique** of societal norms, the transformation of the **concept** of heroism is evident. The **metaphor** of wearing a **costume** becomes a powerful **perspective** on **feelings** in a complicated world. Through this **transformation**, comics reached a new level of narrative depth, presenting **ambiguity** in characters and redefining the **concept** as a serious art form. This elevated comics from simple entertainment to profound **critiques** of reality.
