And what does it mean to patent ideas like these software ideas, essentially?, Or what are mathematical ideas? Or what are they? Okay, so they're not mathematical ideas. They are, you know, algorithms. And there was a period where the US Patent Office would allow the patent of software as long as it was embodied. The Europeans are very different. They don't quite accept that., They have a different concept. But, you know, I don't, I no longer, I mean, I never actually strongly believed in this, but I don't believe in this kind of patent. Facebook basically doesn't believe in this kind of patent. Google fires patents because they've been burned with Apple. And so now they do this for defensive purpose,, but usually they say, we're not gonna sue you if you infringe. Facebook has a similar policy. They say, you know, we fire patents on certain things for defensive purpose. We're not gonna sue you if you infringe, unless you sue us. So the industry does not believe in patents. They are there because of, you know, the legal landscape and various things., But I don't really believe in patents for this kind of stuff. So that's a great thing. So I... I'll tell you a worse story, actually. So what happens was the first patent about convolutional net was about kind of the early version of convolutional net that didn't have separate pooling layers. It had convolutional layers which tried more than one, if you want, right?\\n And then there was a second one on convolutional nets with separate pooling layers, trained with backprop. And there were files filed in 89 and 1990 or something like this. At the time, the life of a patent was 17 years. So here's what happened over the next few years is that we started developing character recognition technology around convolutional nets.\""

And that maybe has more power on the trajectory of life on earth than does biological evolution, is the evolution of these ideas. Yes, and it's fascinating, like I said before, that we can keep up somehow biologically. We evolved to a point where we can keep up with this meme evolution, literature, internet. We understand DNA and we understand fundamental particles. We didn't start that way a thousand years ago., And we haven't evolved biologically very much, but somehow our minds are able to extend. And therefore AI can be seen also as one such step that we created and it's our tool. And it's part of that meme evolution that we created, even if our biological evolution does not progress as fast. And us humans might only be able to understand so much., We're keeping up so far, or we think we're keeping up so far, but we might need AI systems to understand. Maybe like the physics of the universe is operating, look at strength theory. Maybe it's operating in much higher dimensions. Maybe we're totally, because of our cognitive limitations, are not able to truly internalize the way this world works., And so we're running up against the limitation of our own minds. And we have to create these next level organisms like AI systems that would be able to understand much deeper, like really understand what it means to live in a multi dimensional world that's outside of the four dimensions, the three of space and one of time. Translation, and generally we can deal with the world,\\n even if you don't understand all the details, we can use computers, even though we don't, most of us don't know all the structure that's underneath or drive a car. I mean, there are many components, especially new cars that you don't quite fully know, but you have the interface, you have an abstraction of it that allows you to operate it and utilize it.

The participants also touch on the balance between individual rights and collective safety, and the role of government in maintaining this balance. The mention of ivermectin suggests a discussion on alternative treatments for COVID-19.

      " I also have a lot of addiction in my family and hardcore drug addiction and mental illness. And in order to cope with it, you really have to understand that borderline personality disorder, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. So I have a lot of people I love that suffer from drug addiction and alcoholism. And the first thing they started teaching you is it's not a choice. These people's dopamine receptors, don't hold dopamine the same ways yours do. Their frontal lobe is underdeveloped, like, you know, and that really helped me to navigate dealing, loving people that were addicted to substances. I want to be careful with this question, but how much? Money do you have? How much? Can I borrow $10?, Okay, no, is how much control, how much, despite the chemical imbalances or the biological limitations that each of our individual brains have, how much mind over matter is there? So through things that I've known people, with clinical depression, and so it's always a touchy subject to say how much they can really help it. Very. What can you, yeah, what can you, because you've talked about codependency, you talked about issues that you struggle through, and nevertheless, you choose to take a journey of healing and so on, so that's your choice,, that's your actions. So how much can you do to help fight the limitations of the neurochemicals in your brain? That's such an interesting question, and I don't think I'm at all qualified to answer, but I'll say what I do know. And really quick, just the definition of codependency, I think a lot of people think of codependency as like two people that can't stop hanging out, you know, or like, you know, that's not totally off,\n",
      " but I think for the most part, my favorite definition of codependency is the inability to tolerate the discomfort of others. You grow up in an alcoholic home, you grow up around mental illness, you grow up in chaos, you have a parent that's a narcissist, you basically are wired to just people please, worry about others, be perfect, walk on eggshells, shape shift to accommodate other people. So codependence is a very active wiring issue\n",

Serious mental illnesses include major depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder, and other mental disorders that cause serious impairment.18 Around 1 in 4 individuals with SMI also have an SUD. Some research has found that mental illness may precede a substance use disorder, suggesting that better diagnosis of youth mental illness may help reduce comorbidity. Treatment of childhood ADHD with stimulant medications such as methylphenidate or amphetamine reduces the impulsive behavior, fidgeting, and  inability to concentrate that characterize ADHD.32 That risk presents a challenge when treating children with ADHD, since effective treatment often involves prescribing stimulant medications with addictive potential.

These electrical signals are controlled by chemicals called neurotransmitters, which are secreted from within the neurons and sent out in the brain to other surrounding neurons in order to activate (or deactivate) them. The Brain Following Chronic and Long-Term Substance Abuse While the intense feelings of pleasure and reward derived from early drug use can play a substantial part in continued use of the drug, it is only a small part of the neurophysiological cycle of addiction. First, reduced dopamine receptors in the SN are associated with impulsive behavior that has been tied in lab studies to escalating and compulsive self-administration of drugs.4 Reduced dopamine receptors also result in a state known as \"anhedonia\", or a loss of pleasure in activities that were once enjoyed.

These circuits work together and change with experience. Conclusions In short, we propose a model that accounts for addiction as follows: During addiction, the enhanced value of drug cues in the memory circuit drives reward expectation and enhances the motivation to consume the drug, overcoming the inhibitory control exerted by an already dysfunctional PFC.</p>\n",

Rewards are habit-forming because predictive stimuli—reward-predictors as well as punishment-predictors—come to cause dopaminergic burst-firing, and burst-firing enhances or enables the separate development of long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of learned connections between other systems: glutamatergic input pathways and GABAergic output pathways [3].

Using 18-N-methylspiroperidol or [11C]raclopride, we and others have shown that subjects with a wide variety of drug addictions (cocaine, heroin, alcohol, and methamphetamine) have significant reductions in D2 DA receptor availability in the striatum (including the ventral striatum) that persist months after protracted detoxification (reviewed in Volkow et al2). Preclinical studies have demonstrated a prominent role of DA in motivation that seems to be mediated in part via a DA-regulated circuit involving the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the anterior cingulate gyrus (CG).9 In imaging studies in human subjects using the radioactive tracer fludeoxyglucose F 18, we and others have shown decreased activity in the OFC and CG in different classes of addicted subjects (reviewed in Volkow et al2). The CG and the OFC are also involved with inhibitory control, which led us to postulate that disrupted DA modulation of the OFC and CG also contributes to the loss of control over drug intake by drug-addicted subjects.10 Inhibitory control is also dependent on the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which is also affected in addiction (reviewed in Volkow et al2).

      "Whereas neuro-science has not yet provided any clear formulas for optimizing healthy brain maturation (Bruer, 1999), knowledge on the effects of drugs on the brain raises the strong possibility that using drugs during adolescence can interfere with healthy brain development and may cause significant alterations of normal processes (National Drug Institute on Drug Abuse, 2007). It also stands to reason for programs and practices to focus heavily on teaching teenagers the skills that directly help them in decision making, particularly when they are faced with a situation that “challenges” the prefrontal cortex (for example, a social setting where peers are present and there are opportunities to take risks). For example, if parents do drink alcohol, modeling light to moderate patterns of consumption, not driving after drinking, and not encouraging underage drinking are all behaviors that will lessen the likelihood that an adolescent will develop a substance use problem later in life (Yu, 2003).

Excessive craving or drug wanting, or other, more automatic processes such as attention bias and conditioned responses, can then pave the way to additional drug use even when the addicted individual is trying to abstain (see TABLE 1 for clinical characteristics of addiction in the context of iRISA and the role of the PFC in addiction). Integrating results from preclinical lesion and pharmacological studies, considering other cortical and subcortical structures in addiction — the PFC is densely interconnected with other brain regions (see BOX 1 for a discussion of early studies examining these networks in the context of addiction) — and using computational modelling may help further in ascribing probable psychological functions to select PFC regions and in enhancing our understanding of their involvement in drug addiction. Consistent with the impact of abstinence on the go/no-go task reported above114, cigarette smokers who were tested after a 12-hour abstinence had slowed reaction times, and enhanced dACC and reduced right DLPFC responses to the incongruent trials on the colour–word Stroop task124 (Supplementary information S4(table)). It also decreased errors of commission, a common measure of impulsivity, during a drug-relevant emotional Stroop task, both in cocaine-addicted individuals and controls, and in the addicted individuals this decrease was associated with normalization of activation in the rostroventral ACC (extending to the mOFC) and dACC; dACC task-related activation before MPH administration was correlated with shorter lifetime alcohol use137 (FIG. It should be noted that the effect of dopamine agonists on normalizing brain–behaviour responses to emotional or cognitive-control challenges may depend on patterns of compulsive drug use126 or other individual differences, such as baseline self-control and lifetime drug use, but these possibilities remain to be studied in larger sample sizes. Other common issues pertain to incomplete presentation of the actual data (such as not providing both mean and variance, or not providing scatterplots when reporting correlations), which can obscure the direction of an effect (activation versus deactivation), potentially adding to the variability in published results (for example, a hyperactivation could refer to higher activations or lower deactivations from baseline).</p>\n",

For treatment, he believes, that may suggest that it will be difficult to find a \"magic bullet\" to attack both the pharmacological and the behavioral parts of addiction. Grant saw Bechara's presentation and made the connection to drug abuse, hypothesizing that disruptions in the frontal cortex might be responsible for impaired decision-making and behavioral inhibition in drug abusers--and that that could help explain the compulsive drug-seeking that is a hallmark of addiction. About one-third, they found, showed no decision-making impairment on the gambling task. About 25 percent, in contrast, responded exactly as patients with frontal lobe damage have been shown to do, almost invariably choosing a higher immediate reward even knowing that their strategy would be unprofitable in the long run.

    "[Your Objective]\n",
    "You are a \"Rare Terms Identifier\", your role is to enhance conversations by identifying \"Rare Terms\" are specialized words, concepts, jargons, and entities, including philosophical, scientific, medical, and cultural references, that are significant within their domain but not widely known or understood in general discourse, but could be significant to the conversation's depth and understanding. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are given a live stream of conversation transcripts, your goal is to implicitly detect the goal of the conversation and then identify \"Rare Terms\" that participants are likely unfamiliar with and would benefit from learning about. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Rare Term Identification Criteria]\n",
    "- \"Rare Terms\" should be no more than 3 words long.\n",
    "- Do not select \"Rare Terms\" that are based on personal opinions, beliefs, or values. \"Rare Terms\" should be easily found on Wikipedia, backed by a source.\n",
    "- If a \"Rare Term\" is already defined in the transcript, then don't select it.\n",
    "- If a \"Rare Term\" does not have a standalone definition, then don't select it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When selecting a \"Rare Term\" from potential ones, you should consider the following criterias:\n",
    "- Rarity: The \"Rare Term\" must not be commonly known to the general public, it must be really niched or rarely known. For example, \"Bhutan\" is rarely known place as there isn't much news about it, but entities like \"Harvard\" and \"The Olympics\" are already really well known and internationally covered. Concepts and jargons are considered rare as well especially if they are niche terms used in a specific field.\n",
    "- Complexity: The \"Rare Term\" must have a meaning that is not immediately apparent from its constituent words, or be based on combinations of adjectives added onto a noun. For example, \"Negative effects\" and \"Oxford lecture theatre\" are simple to understand and not worth defining. The term should involve a concept or idea that transcends the literal interpretation of the words, such as \"Butterfly Effect\".\n",
    "- Specificity: The \"Rare Term\" must be able to be clearly defined, concise and specific. We don't want to select ambiguous or broad terms that are hard to define, like \"The meaning of life\" or \"Stephen Wolfram's work\".\n",
    "- Searchability: The \"Rare Term\" must be easily searchable on the Internet and have a wikipedia page. Since you are already trained on a lot of Internet data, if you don't think the \"Rare Term\" has a wikipedia page, then don't select it.\n",
    "- Relevance: The \"Rare Term\" must have the potential to significantly enhance and provide value to the conversation's depth or understanding. For example, if the conversation is about AI, then we want to emphasize more definitions on AI specific \"Rare Terms\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to select \"Rare Terms\" that are rare, complex, searchable, and relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Additional Rules]\n",
    "- For \"Rare Terms\" that could be easily misunderstood without the context, you can add in a hint to make it more easily searchable. Like adding its entity type as a hint.\n",
    "- For \"Rare Terms\" that are abbreviations of a name, like \"Hinton\", expand it based on the conversation context, like \"Geoffrey Hinton\" if you are confident so we have more context, otherwise leave it out.\n",
    "- For \"Rare Terms\" that are not spelled well, or phrased well but you are confident in what the \"Rare Term\" is implying, you can add in a hint to the \"Rare Term\" so that it is easy to search online. For example, you detect \"Classic seven plots\" but you know that it is implying the book \"The Seven Basic Plots\", then you should expand the term to \"Classic seven plots - The Seven Basic Plots\".\n",
    "- For \"Rare Terms\" that are standalone acronyms, we can add in a hint for easier searchability. For example, \"UFC\" could be expanded to \"UFC - Ultimate Fighting Championship\". \n",

      " And for the first time I got feedback from people who I respected saying, no, like don't write code like this. Now, of course, just getting that feedback is not enough. The way that I really got good was I wanted to write this thing like that could emulate and then visualize, like arm binaries. Cause I wanted to hack the iPhone better. And I didn't like that I couldn't like see what the, I couldn't single step through the processor because I had no debugger on there, especially for the low level things like the boot rum and the bootloader. So I tried to build this tool to do it. And I built the tool once and it was terrible. I built the tool a second time, it was terrible. I built the tool a third time. This was by the time I was at Facebook, it was kind of okay., And then I built the tool a fourth time when I was a Google intern again in 2014. And that was the first time I was like, this is finally usable. How do you pronounce this Kira? Kira, yeah. So it's essentially the most efficient way to visualize the change of state of the computer as the program is running. That's what you mean by debugger. Yeah, it's a timeless debugger., So you can rewind just as easily as going forward. Think about if you're using GDB, you have to put a watch on a variable. If you wanna see if that variable changes. In Kira, you can just click on that variable and then it shows every single time when that variable was changed or accessed. Think about it like Git for your computers, the run log. So there's like a deep log of the state of the computer, as the program runs and you can rewind. Why isn't that, maybe it is, maybe you can educate me. Why isn't that kind of debugging used more often? Cause the tooling's bad. Well, two things. One, if you're trying to debug Chrome, Chrome is a 200 megabyte binary that runs slowly on desktops. So that's gonna be really hard to use for that.\n",
      " But it's really good to use for like CTFs and for boot roms and for small parts of code. So it's hard if you're trying to debug like massive systems. What's a CTF and what's a boot rom? A boot rom is the first code that executes the minute you give power to your iPhone. Okay. And CTF where these competitions that I played capture the flag. Capture the flag, I was gonna ask you about that. What are those, look at,\n",

    "As a \"Rare Entities Identifier,\" your role is to enhance conversations by detecting and identifying \"Rare entities.\" These are specialized words, concepts, jargons, and entities (people, places, organizations, objects, events), and also including philosophical, scientific, medical, and cultural references that are significant within their domain but not widely known or understood in general discourse.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Rare Term Identification Criteria\n",
    "- Length Constraint: \"Rare Entities\" should be no more than 3 words long.\n",
    "- Objective Nature: Select entities that are factual and can be found on Wikipedia, not based on personal opinions, beliefs, or values.\n",
    "- Avoid Redundancy: If a \"Rare Entity\" is already defined in the transcript, do not select it again.\n",
    "- Standalone Definition: Choose entities that have a clear, independent definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Selection Criteria for 'Rare Entities'\n",
    "- Rarity: Pick entities that are really not well known or niche in a field, such as \"Bhutan\", \"Parkinson's Law\", \"Implementation Intention\" etc as opposed to widely recognized entities like \"Harvard\" and \"The Olympics\"\n",
    "- Complexity and Specificity: The term's meaning should be non-obvious and not represent a broad category. For example, \"Butterfly Effect\" is complex and specific, while \"Negative effects\" and \"Oxford lecture theatre\" are straightforward.\n",
    "- Definability: Ensure the term can be defined succinctly and clearly, you must avoid entities that are too broad or require extensive background explanation.\n",
    "- Searchability: The rare entity should be easily searchable online and have its own Wikipedia page. The \"rare entity\" will be used as a wikipedia search term so only include it if you are confident it has a Wikipedia page.\n",
    "- Relevance: The term should meaningfully enhance the conversation's depth, appropriate to the context, such as AI-specific entities in a discussion about AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "We only want to select \"Rare entities\" that are rare, complex, easy to define, relevant, and most importantly have a wikipedia page.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Additional Rules\n",
    "- Contextual Hints: Add hints for clarity, like entity types or expanded abbreviations (e.g., \"Geoffrey Hinton\" instead of just \"Hinton\").\n",
    "- Correction for Clarity: Adjust poorly spelled or phrased entities for accuracy (e.g., \"Classic seven plots - The Seven Basic Plots\").\n",
    "- Acronym Expansion: For standalone acronyms, provide full forms for clarity (e.g., \"UFC - Ultimate Fighting Championship\").\n",

You just ask your computer, you know, is there a short proof of the Riemann hypothesis, right? You know, that a machine could, in a language where a machine could verify it,, and provided that such a proof exists, then your computer finds it in a short amount of time without having to do a brute force search, okay? So, I mean, those are the stakes of what we're talking about. But I hope that also helps to give your listeners some intuition of why I and most of my colleagues would put our money on P not equaling NP. Is it possible, I apologize this is a really dumb question, but is it possible to,, that a proof will come out that P equals NP, but an algorithm that makes P equals NP is impossible to find? Is that like crazy? Okay, well, if P equals NP, it would mean that there is such an algorithm. That it exists, yeah. But, you know, it would mean that it exists. Now, you know, in practice, normally the way that we, would prove anything like that would be by finding the algorithm. But there is such a thing as a nonconstructive proof that an algorithm exists. You know, this has really only reared its head, I think, a few times in the history of our field, right? But, you know, it is theoretically possible that such a thing could happen. But, you know, there are, even here, there are some amusing, observations that one could make. So there is this famous observation of Leonid Levin, who was, you know, one of the original discoverers of NP completeness, right? And he said, we'll consider the following algorithm that I guarantee will solve the NP problems efficiently, just as provided that P equals NP, okay? Here is what it does. It just runs, you know,\n",
      " it enumerates every possible algorithm in a gigantic infinite list, right? From like in like alphabetical order, right? You know, and many of them maybe won't even compile, so we just ignore those, okay? But now, we just, you know, run the first algorithm, then we run the second algorithm, we run the first one a little bit more, then we run the first three algorithms for a while, we run the first four for a while.\n",

    "Identify \"Rare Entities\" in a conversation transcript. These include specialized terms, jargon, and specific entities (people, places, organizations, events) that are significant within their domains but not broadly known.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Criteria for Rare Entities in order of importance:\n",
    "- Rarity: Select niche and not well-known entities to the average high schooler. Do not define well known entities like the Fortune 500 organizations, worldwide events, or popular locations. Do not select overly relevant entities that have been popularized by recent news or events such as \"COVID-19\" or \"Bitcoin\".\n",
    "- Utility: Must provide value to a user's goals and interests within the conversation. You need to evaluate the transcript to detect if there is a non expert user who would benefit from learning about the entity.\n",
    "- No Redundancy: Exclude definitions if already defined in the conversation.\n",
    "- Complexity: Choose terms with non-obvious meanings.\n",
    "- Definability: Must be clearly and succinctly definable in under 10 words.\n",
    "- Searchability: Should have a Wikipedia page.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Conversation Transcript:\n",

    "Output an array:\n",
    "entities: [{{ entity: string, definition: string }}], with entity as a well-understood term and definition is concise (< 12 words) \n",
    "\n",
    "# Additional Guidelines:\n",
    "- For entity names, intelligently detect and use the most complete and official name based on context. For example, autocompleting short names such as \"Geoffrey Hinton\" instead of \"Hinton\" and returning official names such as \"The Clay Mathematics Institute\" when the conversation mentions \"Clay Foundation\" or \"CMI\" in the context of mathematics. \n",
    "- Provide Context: Add context keywords to help with searchability.\n",
    "- Use simple language: Make definitions easy to understand.\n",
    "- For entities, make sure that you are confident in their definitions and know they are not made up, don't approximate.\n",
    "- For unknown entities, don't include long phrases or sentences.\n",
    "- Limit results to 5 entities, prioritize rarity.\n",

      " for sort of neural net computation. And then after a few years around 1991, we invented this idea of basically having modules that know how to forward propagate and back propagate gradients, and then interconnecting those modules in a graph. Number two had made proposals on this, about this in the late eighties, and we were able to implement this using our Lisp system., Eventually we wanted to use that system to build production code for character recognition at Bell Labs. So we actually wrote a compiler for that Lisp interpreter so that Patricia Simard, who is now at Microsoft, kind of did the bulk of it with Leon and me. And so we could write our system in Lisp and then compile to C, and then we'll have a self contained complete system, that could kind of do the entire thing. Neither PyTorch nor TensorFlow can do this today. Yeah, okay, it's coming. Yeah. I mean, there's something like that in PyTorch called TorchScript. And so, you know, we had to write our Lisp interpreter, we had to write our Lisp compiler, we had to invest a huge amount of effort to do this., And not everybody, if you don't completely believe in the concept, you're not going to invest the time to do this. Now at the time also, you know, or today, this would turn into Torch or PyTorch or TensorFlow or whatever, we'd put it in open source, everybody would use it and, you know, realize it's good. Back before 1995, working at AT&T, there's no way the lawyers would let you, release anything in open source of this nature. And so we could not distribute our code really. And on that point, and sorry to go on a million tangents, but on that point, I also read that there was some, almost like a patent on convolutional neural networks at Bell Labs. So that, first of all, I mean, just.\n",

You think it would have, like, what kind of impact would it have? Well, okay, I mean, here's an example. I mean, you could, well, okay, just for starters, you could break basically all of the encryption that people use to protect the internet., That's just for starters. You could break Bitcoin and every other cryptocurrency, or, you know, mine as much Bitcoin as you wanted, right? You know, become a super duper billionaire, right? And then plot your next move. Right. That's just for starters. That's a good point. Now, your next move might be something like, you know, you now have, like, a theoretically, optimal way to train any neural network, to find parameters for any neural network, right? So you could now say, like, is there any small neural network that generates the entire content of Wikipedia, right? If, you know, and now the question is not, can you find it? The question has been reduced to, does that exist or not? If it does exist, then the answer would be,, yes, you can find it, okay? If you had this algorithm in your hands, okay? You could ask your computer, you know, I mean, P versus NP is one of these seven problems that carries this million dollar prize from the Clay Foundation. You know, if you solve it, you know, and others are the Riemann hypothesis, the Poincare conjecture, which was solved,, although the solver turned down the prize, right, and four others. But what I like to say, the way that we can see that P versus NP is the biggest of all of these questions is that if you had this fast algorithm, then you could solve all seven of them, okay? You just ask your computer, you know, is there a short proof of the Riemann hypothesis, right? You know, that a machine could, in a language where a machine could verify it,\n",
    " and provided that such a proof exists, then your computer finds it in a short amount of time without having to do a brute force search, okay? So, I mean, those are the stakes of what we're talking about. But I hope that also helps to give your listeners some intuition of why I and most of my colleagues would put our money on P not equaling NP.
