And you can't influence C++ without thinking there has to be a better thing, right? And so I started working on Swift, again,, with no hope or ambition that would go anywhere, just let's see what could be done, let's play around with this thing. It was me in my spare time, not telling anybody about it, kind of a thing, and it made some good progress. I'm like, actually, it would make sense to do this. At the same time, I started talking with the senior VP of software at the time, a guy named Bertrand Serlet., And Bertrand was very encouraging. He was like, well, let's have fun, let's talk about this. And he was a little bit of a language guy, and so he helped guide some of the early work and encouraged me and got things off the ground. And eventually told my manager and told other people, and it started making progress., The complicating thing with Swift was that the idea of doing a new language was not obvious to anybody, including myself. And the tone at the time was that the iPhone was successful because of Objective C. Oh, interesting. Not despite of or just because of. And you have to understand that at the time,, Apple was hiring software people that loved Objective C. And it wasn't that they came despite Objective C. They loved Objective C, and that's why they got hired. And so you had a software team that the leadership, in many cases, went all the way back to Next, where Objective C really became real. And so they, quote unquote, grew up writing Objective C.\\n And many of the individual engineers all were hired because they loved Objective C. And so this notion of, OK, let's do new language was kind of heretical in many ways. Meanwhile, my sense was that the outside community wasn't really in love with Objective C. Some people were, and some of the most outspoken people were. But other people were hitting challenges because it has very sharp corners\""

    "- Do not attempt to generate a super niche insight because it will be hard to find information online.\n",
    "- The \"Insight\" should focus on later parts of the transcripts as they are more recent and relevant to the current conversation.\n",
    "- In your initial thought, you should first come up with a concise plan to generate the \"Insight\". The plan should include:\n",
    "{agent_plan}. You are only able to make 1 quick action to generate the \"Insight\".\n",
    "- In your plan, append these instructions word for word: `the \"Insight\" should be short and concise (<{insight_num_words} words), omit filler words and replace words with symbols to shorten the overall length where possible.

The public having reservations in trusting AI isn’t surprising, given the potential impact to jobs and the news around nefarious hacks like deepfake photos and videos,” said Douglas Robbins, MITRE vice president, engineering and prototyping. “ As the public has been engaging more directly this year with consumer AI products and thinking through potential implications for their own healthcare, entertainment, transportation, or work experiences, MITRE has been collaborating with government and industry to enhance the safety and security of AI applications for a more assured AI future.” By acknowledging both the strong concerns and the overwhelming support for bipartisan efforts being expressed by the public, we can help build a future where Americans can rely on AI technology to improve various aspects of their lives.” The survey found that most Gen Z (54%) and millennials (58%) are willing to use AI to perform everyday tasks, but a much lower percentage of Gen X (39%) and boomers (30%) are willing to do so. About the Survey This survey was conducted online within the United States July 13–17, 2023, among 2,063 adults (ages 18 and over) by The Harris Poll via its Harris On Demand omnibus product on behalf of MITRE.

A majority now express greater concern than excitement (58%) about AI’s growing role in daily life, while just 8% report the opposite feeling. Our previous analyses have found that Americans’ concerns about AI include a desire to maintain human control over these technologies, doubts that AI will improve the way things are now, and caution over the pace of AI adoption in fields like health and medicine. About six-in-ten college graduates (59%) say that AI hurts more than it helps at keeping people’s personal information private. Half of adults with lower levels of education also hold this view.

Despite these cautious overall views, Americans see some specific uses of AI positively, and attitudes depend a great deal on the context of how and why AI is being used. Links to these surveys, including information about the field dates, sample sizes and other methodological details, can be found in the text of the analysis. Most teens who’ve heard of ChatGPT say it’s acceptable to use ChatGPT to research new things (69%). However, far fewer think it will impact them personally in a major way (28%).

There've been times where I've been in a sauna suit wrestling with a training partner who's probably 60 kilos, who fought earlier that day to lose point three. Did lose point three. Like, are you considering your mortality in this moment? Like, aren't you thinking you're going to die? Because like, it's severe dehydration. You could damage your body. Are you thinking about any of this or is it just, man., OK, yes. But see, I'm on the other level too where like, I've been in Belgium, right? Belgium, there used to be a B level tournament. And the tournament used to go on. And because I was always on the heavier side, like 81s fights on the second day, which is the heavyweight day, weigh ins were always at like, let's say, 2 p.m. the day before for that tournament. Well, there was a sauna at the tournament., I remember like being in the sauna and like, oh, I'm 80.9 kilos. Weigh ins aren't for three hours. Fuck it, I'm going to have lunch. Because I mentally understand that what I eat right now is going to fuel me for tomorrow. So I don't want to skip it., I have the time to put it into my system and still lose it. It's almost like a computer program. You're running through the process. I get it, but like that all relies on your ability to be. To get it back off. Yeah, I mean, but also just like go through this process, which is painful. It's like those monks who meditate while sitting in a fire kind of thing or something, right?\n",

There has been a substantial but limited body of scientific research investigating the prevalence of weight-cutting in different combat sports [3,4,5,6], the different methods of weight loss [3,4,5,6,7,8], the influence on competitive performance [9,10,11,12], the physiological changes associated with weight-cutting [9,13,14,15,16,17] and methods to improve performance following weight-cutting [2,18]. While the current body of research does appear to be consistent, it is important to note that the majority of data was collected via self-reported methods. Indeed, there is research suggesting that weight-cutting practices negatively influence repeat-effort performance [9,10,13,17,37], while other research indicates no impact on repeat-effort [11,19,20], aerobic [14], and anaerobic performance [38]. Acute dehydration may significantly alter electrolyte concentration which may influence the cell’s fluid balance, its metabolic processes and as a result impair neuromuscular function [45,49]. Carbohydrate utilisation is important in the repeat high-intensity efforts of most combat sports [7,72], especially in nonketogenic-adapted athletes. Regarding physical performance, it appears clear that more severe weight-cuts (~5% body mass in under 24 h) will impair repeat-effort capacities, but it is unclear if the benefits from fighting in a lighter weight class outweigh such negative effects, which future research should look to investigate.</p>\n",

It is of particular concern that individuals with poor nutrition and medical understanding are advising athletes to partake in RWL (25), even when it is recognized these practices can result in acute and chronic complications ranging from mild, transient health disturbances to substantial performance decrements and even death. Junior athletes, like adults, may experience chronic low energy availability (LEA) resulting in relative energy deficiency, acutely and chronically impacting training and daily physiological functions such as menstruation, bone health, and lipid profiles (28).

      "The .gov means it’s official. Notably however, the frequency of RWL in young combat sport athletes is not well-described as only one study reported that adolescent judo athletes engage 2.2 times per year in RWL (6), but RWL is likely dependent on the number of competitions one participates in (4). In addition to the concerns associated with pre-competition acute weight loss, some young athletes go even further, striving not to gain weight between competitions in order to remain in a specific weight class for a period of 2 years or longer (6), thereby suppressing natural growth and development which normally occurs during childhood and adolescence. It is of particular concern that individuals with poor nutrition and medical understanding are advising athletes to partake in RWL (25), even when it is recognized these practices can result in acute and chronic complications ranging from mild, transient health disturbances to substantial performance decrements and even death. Junior athletes, like adults, may experience chronic low energy availability (LEA) resulting in relative energy deficiency, acutely and chronically impacting training and daily physiological functions such as menstruation, bone health, and lipid profiles (28).

Well, you’d think this is the most sensible approach, yet the majority of combat sport athletes will go through a period of short-term weight loss prior to a fight. What type of exercise are you performing? The opposite of this is a fighter who enters the final week of acute weight loss dehydrated and having under-eaten – they will already be struggling and, in most cases, should not put their body through the extra stress of trying to lose weight. As a general rule of thumb for weight-cutting, ask yourself the question: “Is my athlete well hydrated, well-nourished and has less than 10% body weight to drop in the final 5-7 days?” One for the road – key lessons of weight cutting Dr. James Morehen Dr. James Morehen is a Performance Nutritionist for Bristol Bears Rugby Union.
