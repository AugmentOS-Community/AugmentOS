 turns out that if you train a planarian and then cut their heads off, the tail will regenerate a

00:04.640 --> 00:09.760
 brand new brain that still remembers the original information. I think planaria hold the answer to

00:09.760 --> 00:14.800
 pretty much every deep question of life. For one thing, they're similar to our ancestors. So they

00:14.800 --> 00:17.600
 have true symmetry, they have a true brain, they're not like earthworms, they're, you know,

00:17.600 --> 00:20.640
 they're much more advanced life form. They have lots of different internal organs, but they're

00:20.640 --> 00:24.560
 these little, they're about, you know, maybe two centimeters in the centimeter to two in size.

00:24.560 --> 00:30.640
 And they have a head and a tail. And the first thing is planaria are immortal. So they do not

00:30.640 --> 00:34.320
 age. There's no such thing as an old planarian. So that right there tells you that these theories

00:34.320 --> 00:40.080
 of thermodynamic limitations on lifespan are wrong. It's not that well over time of everything

00:40.080 --> 00:44.560
 degrades. No, planaria can keep it going for probably, you know, how long have they been

00:44.560 --> 00:48.640
 around 400 million years, right? So these are the actual, so the planaria in our lab

00:48.640 --> 00:54.880
 are actually in physical continuity with planaria that were here 400 million years ago.

00:54.880 --> 01:00.080
 The following is a conversation with Michael Levin, one of the most fascinating and brilliant

01:00.080 --> 01:07.120
 biologists I've ever talked to. He and his lab at Tufts University works on novel ways to understand

01:07.120 --> 01:12.960
 and control complex pattern formation in biological systems. Andre Karpathy, a world

01:12.960 --> 01:18.880
 class AI researcher, is the person who first introduced me to Michael Levin's work. I bring

01:18.880 --> 01:25.680
 this up because these two people make me realize that biology has a lot to teach us about AI,

01:25.680 --> 01:32.000
 and AI might have a lot to teach us about biology. This is the Lex Friedman podcast.

01:32.000 --> 01:37.440
 To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description. And now, dear friends,

01:37.440 --> 01:44.480
 here's Michael Levin. Embryogenesis is the process of building the human body from a single cell. I

01:44.480 --> 01:50.160
 think it's one of the most incredible things that exists on earth from a single embryo. So how does

01:50.160 --> 01:56.080
 this process work? Yeah, it is an incredible process. I think it's maybe the most magical

01:56.080 --> 02:01.520
 process there is. And I think one of the most fundamentally interesting things about it is that

02:01.520 --> 02:07.120
 it shows that each of us takes the journey from so called just physics to mind, right? Because we

02:07.120 --> 02:12.880
 all start life as a single quiescent, unfertilized oocyte, and it's basically a bag of chemicals,

02:12.880 --> 02:16.720
 and you look at that and you say, okay, this is chemistry and physics. And then nine months and

02:16.720 --> 02:22.320
 some years later, you have an organism with high level cognition and preferences and an inner life

02:22.320 --> 02:27.520
 and so on. And what embryogenesis tells us is that that transformation from physics to mind is

02:27.520 --> 02:32.560
 gradual. It's smooth. There is no special place where, you know, a lightning bolt says, boom,

02:32.560 --> 02:37.440
 now you've gone from physics to true cognition. That doesn't happen. And so we can see in this

02:37.440 --> 02:41.440
 process that the whole mystery, you know, the biggest mystery of the universe, basically,

02:41.440 --> 02:47.680
 how you get mind from matter. From just physics, in quotes. Yeah. So where's the magic into the

02:47.680 --> 02:54.480
 thing? How do we get from information encoded in DNA and make physical reality out of that

02:54.480 --> 02:59.280
 information? So one of the things that I think is really important if we're going to bring in DNA

02:59.280 --> 03:05.520
 into this picture is to think about the fact that what DNA encodes is the hardware of life. DNA

03:05.520 --> 03:09.760
 contains the instructions for the kind of micro level hardware that every cell gets to play with.

03:09.760 --> 03:14.160
 So all the proteins, all the signaling factors, the ion channels, all the cool little pieces of

03:14.160 --> 03:20.640
 hardware that cells have, that's what's in the DNA. The rest of it is in so called generic laws.

03:20.640 --> 03:25.920
 And these are laws of mathematics. These are laws of computation. These are laws of physics,

03:25.920 --> 03:32.000
 of all kinds of interesting things that are not directly in the DNA. And that process, you know,

03:32.000 --> 03:36.800
 I think the reason I always put just physics in quotes is because I don't think there is such a

03:36.800 --> 03:41.520
 thing as just physics. I think that thinking about these things in binary categories, like this is

03:41.520 --> 03:45.840
 physics, this is true cognition, this is as if it's only faking these kinds of things. I think

03:45.840 --> 03:49.760
 that's what gets us in trouble. I think that we really have to understand that it's a continuum

03:49.760 --> 03:53.600
 and we have to work up the scaling, the laws of scaling. And we can certainly talk about that.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.640
 There's a lot of really interesting thoughts to be had there.

03:56.640 --> 04:03.200
 So the physics is deeply integrated with the information. So the DNA doesn't exist on its own.

04:03.200 --> 04:10.480
 The DNA is integrated as, in some sense, in response to the laws of physics at every scale.

04:10.480 --> 04:14.080
 The laws of the environment it exists in.

04:14.080 --> 04:18.960
 Yeah, the environment and also the laws of the universe. I mean, the thing about the DNA is that

04:18.960 --> 04:25.440
 it's once evolution discovers a certain kind of machine, that if the physical implementation is

04:25.440 --> 04:29.920
 appropriate, it's sort of, and this is hard to talk about because we don't have a good vocabulary

04:29.920 --> 04:36.560
 for this yet, but it's a very kind of a platonic notion that if the machine is there, it pulls down

04:36.560 --> 04:42.960
 interesting things that you do not have to evolve from scratch because the laws of physics give it

04:42.960 --> 04:47.200
 to you for free. So just as a really stupid example, if you're trying to evolve a particular

04:47.200 --> 04:50.720
 triangle, you can evolve the first angle and you evolve the second angle, but you don't need to

04:50.720 --> 04:54.480
 evolve the third. You know what it is already. Now, why do you know? That's a gift for free

04:54.480 --> 04:58.240
 from geometry in a particular space. You know what that angle has to be. And if you evolve

04:58.240 --> 05:01.920
 an ion channel, which is, ion channels are basically transistors, right? They're voltage

05:01.920 --> 05:06.720
 gated current conductances. If you evolve that ion channel, you immediately get to use things
